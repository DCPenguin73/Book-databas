# Overview

This is a database that keeps track of books

I made this program so I could create a list of books I have finished, started, and want to read in the future.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

There is one table with each row being its own book. There are columns for title, author, publication year, and if you have finished the book.

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code to make this program

This was made in python using the squlie3 library.
